description: PearsDB is an AI Automation platform for building AI/ML powered features and applications.

PearsDB works by connecting any source of data with any model or framework and automating how real-time data flows between them. As you can connect any data source with any model, you can build and automate any use case.

## Sample AI Workflow

We can automate any workflow end-to-end using PearsDB’s Jobs command. Take an AI workflow featuring integrations with [Binance](/integrations/app-integrations/binance) (our data source), [TimeGPT](/integrations/ai-engines/timegpt) (our forecasting model), and [Slack](/integrations/app-integrations/slack) (where we’ll publish the outputs from the forecasting model). In this scenario, you can seamlessly retrieve real-time trading data from Binance, utilize it as input for a TimeGPT model to generate forecasts, and receive these forecasts as Slack notifications.

Check out the **Use Cases** section for more examples and tutorials.

## Benefits of PearsDB

1. **Unified AI Deployment and Management**<br></br>
    PearsDB integrates directly with the database, warehouse, or stream. This eliminates the need to build and maintain custom, complex data pipelines or separate systems for AI/ML deployment.

2. **Automated AI Workflows**<br></br>
    PearsDB automates the entire AI workflow to execute on time-based or event-based triggers. No need to build custom automation logic to get predictions, move data, or (re)train models.

3. **Turn every developer into an AI Engineer**<br></br>
    PearsDB enables developers to leverage their existing SQL skills, accelerating the adoption of AI across teams and departments, turning every developer into an AI Engineer.

4. **Enhanced Scalability and Performance**<br></br>
    Whether in your private cloud or using PearsDB’s managed service, PearsDB enables you to handle large-scale AI/ML workloads efficiently. PearsDB can scale to meet the demands of your use case, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.
